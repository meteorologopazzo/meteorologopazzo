I felt like I needed to spit this down on my notebook as fast as possible to make it as real as I could you know, but I kinda struggle a little with 
blank spaces and line formatting, so I dropped a < pre > element

Oh wind
Oh wind
thou only 
can bubble 
these words 
to my lips
but if thou's 
to blow 
too strong
methinks   i    could      easilyy    fly                awaayayyyyy
