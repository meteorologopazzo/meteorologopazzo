I felt like I needed to spit this down on my notebook as fast as possible to make it as real as I could you know, but I kinda struggle a little with 
blank spaces and line formatting, so I dropped a < pre > element <strong> right </strong> where it needed be

Oh wind
thou only

but if thou's

methinks   i    could      easilyy    fly                awaayayyyyy
